  'Welcome to the first edition of Luxury Market Insights, a resource designed to keep you informed about the latest trends shaping Downtown St Petersburg''s luxury condo market.

I''m Aline Sarria, Luxury Condo Specialist on The Crawford Team at Keller Williams St Pete. My focus is on connecting discerning buyers, sellers, and international investors to exceptional opportunities in our thriving market - from waterfront high rises to record-setting penthouse sales.

This series begins with the story of how the world''s #1 real estate company, Keller Williams, is setting new standards for luxury worldwide, and how its strength directly benefits buyers and sellers here in St Petersburg.
